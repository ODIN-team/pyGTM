Welcome to GTM documentation
=====================================


This program implements the generalized 4x4 transfer matrix (GTM) method poposed in 
[Passler, N. C. and Paarmann, A., JOSA B 34, 2128 (2017)](http://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAB.34.002128)
and corrected in [to be inserted](). A Matlab code can be downloaded on [zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.601496).  
This Python implemetation also relies on inputs from D. Dietze's FSRStools code
